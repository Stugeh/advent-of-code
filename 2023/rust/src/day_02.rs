// --- Day 2: Cube Conundrum ---
// Cubes are either red, green or blue.
// In a bag there are a random number of cubes of each color.
//
// Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag.
// He'll do this a few times per game.
//
// Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in Game 11: ...) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).
//
// For example, the record of a few games might look like this:
//
// Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
// Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
// Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
// Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
// Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
//
// What is the sum of the IDs of games possible with 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?
